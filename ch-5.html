${D(S('Kessler','"Consciousness doesn\'t CREATE reality. It SELECTS. The possibilities already exist. Consciousness chooses which becomes real. Every time you observe something, you\'re killing every other version of what it could have been. Every glance is a genocide of possibilities."'))}
${D(S('Kessler','"Now apply this to yourself. A consciousness that only observes, without acting — it stops collapsing its own wave function. It stops choosing itself into existence. It becomes probability without actuality. It fades."'))}
${D(S('Kairo','"If every observation kills possibilities... isn\'t participating just choosing which realities to murder?"'))}

${P('Page 14 – 18')}
